# Features

* No support for authors (but should be doable)
  * Link to correct page.
  * Have as default a list of books of that author (descending)
  * Have in the directory authors the option to define a page with additional information about the author.
* All authors page: should be doable, why not start on that? Not part of the original blog.
* Underline for links?: Original blog removed that, should be ok. Color is enough to show what is clickable.
* Backlink to all books: necessary or not? As long as only books are here in, perhaps that is ok. Or I move all content (books, blogs, perhaps something else ...) to the blog, so there will be theme pages then.
